# Mint
I'm a firm believer that data can be used to optimize our lives. One of the areas I'm using my data engineering skills in my personal life is the understanding and analysis of my household's spending, saving and investing habits.

A few years ago, I discovered Mint (no affiliation) and have since used it to track my financial activity across accounts. The [mint-api]('https://github.com/mintapi/mintapi') is an unofficial API/Python SDK that allows developers to fetch account data in real time. The library is built on Selenium, so it's important to ensure that the browser used (Chrome) is updated accordingly.
