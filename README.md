# Mint Project Description
I'm a firm believer that data can be used to optimize our lives. One of the areas I'm using my data engineering skills in my personal life is the understanding and analysis of my household's spending, saving and investing habits.

A few years ago, I discovered Mint (no affiliation) and have since used it to track my financial activity across accounts. 
The [mint-api]('https://github.com/mintapi/mintapi') is an unofficial API/Python SDK that allows developers to fetch account data in real time.
The library is built on Selenium, so it's important to ensure that the browser used (Chrome) is updated accordingly.


# Reddit News Project Description
Throughout my undergrad I was obssessed with going through sub reddits, I'm still a news junkie. One of my favorite places to get news is Reddit, due to the intuitive aggregation and interactive comments sections.

While the original build for the Reddit connection was straightforward, it was one of the first ETL pipelines I built as a side project last year after deep diving into this topic more . I recently revisited the pipeline and refactored it according to best coding practices.
